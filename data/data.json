    "description": "Bathythermograph data were collected from the GRESHAM within a 1-mile radius of Ocean Weather Station N (3000N 14000W) and in transit. Data were collected by the United States Coast Guard from 07 Februay 1967 to 28 February 1967. The platform was equipped and staffed to observe weather and sea conditions. Data were processed by NODC to the NODC standard Universal Bathythermograph Output (UBT) format. Full format description is available from NODC at www.nodc.noaa.gov/General/NODC-Archive/bt.html.\n\nThe UBT file format is used for temperature-depth profile data obtained using the mechanical bathythermograph (MBT) instrument. The maximum depth of MBT observations is approximately 285 m. Therefore, MBT data are useful only in studying the thermal structure of the upper layers of the ocean. Cruise information, date, position, and time are reported for each observation. The data record comprises pairs of temperature-depth values. Temperature data in this file are recorded at uniform 5 m depth intervals.",

SCRIPPS and other platforms from the Coastal Waters of California from January 23, 1983 to December 8, 1983. Data were submitted by Scripps Institution of Oceanography as part of the California Cooperative Fisheries Investigation (CALCOFI) project. Data were processed by NODC to the NODC standard Oceanographic Station Data (SD2) and the Universal Bathythermograph Output (UBT) formats. Full format descriptions are available at nodc.noaa.gov/.\n\nThe Oceanographic Station Data format contains physical-chemical oceanographic data recorded at discrete depth levels. Most of the observations were made using multi-bottle Nansen casts or other types of water samplers. A small amount (about 5 percent) were obtained using electronic CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) or STD (salinity- temperature-depth) recorders. The CTD/STD data were reported to NODC at depth levels equivalent to Nansen cast data, however, and have been processed and stored the same as the Nansen data. Cruise information (e.g., ship, country, institution), position, date, and time, and reported for each station. The principal measured parameters and temperature and salinity , but dissolved oxygen, phosphate, total phosphorus, silicate, nitrate, nitrite, and pH may be reported. Meteorological conditions at the time of the cast (e.g., air temperature and pressure, wind, waves) may also be reported, as well as auxiliary data such as water color (Forel-Ule scale), water transparency (Secchi disk depth), and depth to bottom. Values of density (sigma-t) sound velocity, and dynamic depth anomaly are computed from measured parameters. Each station contains the measurements taken at the observed depth levels, but also includes data values interpolated to a set of standard depth levels.",

Data were processed by NODC to the NODC standard Universal Bathythermograph Output (UBT) format. Full format description is available from NODC at www.nodc.noaa.gov/General/NODC-Archive/bt.html.\n\nThe UBT file format is used for temperature-depth profile data obtained using the mechanical bathythermograph (MBT) instrument. The maximum depth of MBT observations is approximately 285 m. Therefore, MBT data are useful only in studying the thermal structure of the upper layers of the ocean. Cruise information, date, position, and time are reported for each observation. The data record comprises pairs of temperature-depth values. Temperature data in this file are recorded at uniform 5 m depth intervals.",

GOULD during cruises LMG0106 and LMG0205 in the South Atlantic Ocean and South Pacific Ocean from 2001-07-29 to 2002-09-09. These data include SPECIES IDENTIFICATION - DRY WEIGHT, SPECIES IDENTIFICATION - ORGANISM LENGTH, Condition factor, Carbon content of specimen and Nitrogen content of specimen. The instruments used to collect these data include net - plankton net. These data were collected by Langdon Quetin and Robin Ross of University of California-Santa Barbara as part of Southern Ocean GLOBEC. The Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) submitted these data to NODC on 2013-07-25.\n\nThe following is the text of the abstract provided by BCO-DMO:\n\nThe goal of the larval krill studies was to investigate the physiology and ecology of krill larvae associated with the pack ice and the microbial community on which they feed.\nDuring LMG0106 we occupied two 4-5 day ice stations (Robert and Billy) and sampled several other ice floes opportunistically. We conducted 10 instantaneous growth rate experiments, and 4 whole body clearance time experiments to determine gut passage time (decline in pigment content over time). We also sampled larvae at two additional sites for initial body pigment content (whole body fluorescence), and at 4 sites for condition factor. The under-ice algal community was sampled at one site. Length and stage frequency determinations were also determined.\nWe occupied three time-series stations of approximately 1 week each, and in addition opportunistically sampled at times when other activities had priority. Our primary goal during the cruise was to occupy three ice camps or process stations with the intent of thoroughly studying the under-ice environment by SCUBA in conjunction with other projects working topside.

    "description": "The Regional Ocean Forecast System (ROFS) has been developed jointly by the Ocean Modeling Branch of the National Weather Service's Environmental Modeling Center, the National Ocean Service's Coast Survey Development Lab, Princeton University, and Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO). ROFS is based on a hydrodynamic, three-dimensional ocean circulation model (Princeton Ocean Model) which simulates temperature, salinity, surface elevation, and currents for a region off the U.S. East Coast from ~30 to 47N and out to 50W. The model is driven at the ocean surface boundary by heat, moisture, and momentum fluxes provided by NCEP's Eta mesoscale atmospheric forecast model. The ocean model is driven along its open (that is, southern and eastern) boundaries by climatological estimates of temperature, salinity, and transport. The spatial resolution of the model varies from approximately 20km offshore to about 10km nearshore. The coastal boundary corresponds to the location of the 10m isobath. In the vertical, an 18-layer sigma (terrain-following) coordinate system is used with at least half the layers concentrated in the upper 100m. Tidal forcing is included in the model.\n\nThe forecast cycle generates regional ocean forecasts out to 48 hours. Surface forcing is obtained from the 3-hourly surface fields from NCEP's Eta mesoscale atmospheric prediction model.

The MK21 data acquisition system was used to log the raw data and the standard depth equation was used to determine probe depth. The data were subsequently bin-averaged into 1 m bins. The XBT data were collected during R/V Endeavor cruise EN492 to the region northeast of Flemish Cap in the Northwest Atlantic. The purpose of the cruise was to observe the process of anticyclonic eddy generation and evolution in the so-called Northwest Corner region, where the northward-flowing North Atlantic current turns to flow eastward. During the cruise the upper ocean hydrography, in an approximately 250 km square region centered on the turning region, was observed with a grid of CTD casts to 1000 db spaced approximately 50 km apart. The XBT was deployed at roughly the midpoints of some of the transits between CTD stations and at other locations north of Flemish Cap.",

Full format description is available from NODC at www.nodc.noaa.gov/General/NODC-Archive/bt.html.\n\nThe UBT file format is used for temperature-depth profile data obtained using the mechanical bathythermograph (MBT) instrument. The maximum depth of MBT observations is approximately 285 m. Therefore, MBT data are useful only in studying the thermal structure of the upper layers of the ocean. Cruise information, date, position, and time are reported for each observation. The data record comprises pairs of temperature-depth values. Temperature data in this file are recorded at uniform 5 m depth intervals.",

An objective of the program is to develop baseline information on the organisms inhabiting the sanctuaries and on the physical characteristics of the sanctuaries. To achieve this objective, Beach Watch volunteers have taken photographic slides of animals (both alive and dead) and beach profiles during surveys of over fifty sanctuary beaches every two to four weeks since 1993.\n\nAs part of a \"data rescue\" effort, GFNMS, FMSA, and NOAA's National Oceanographic Data Center and Climate Database Modernization Program have sponsored a project to scan Beach Watch's photographic slides and create high-resolution TIFF and Web-accessible JPEG images for the public. This collection is part of the project, which Jan Roletto of GFNMS coordinated for FMSA, and it contains images from surveys of Dillon Beach (segment 1-10), California from 1996-11-04 to 1997-11-27.",

Data were processed by NODC to the NODC standard Universal Bathythermograph Output (UBT) format. Full format description is available from NODC at www.nodc.noaa.gov/General/NODC-Archive/bt.html.\n\nThe UBT file format is used for temperature-depth profile data obtained using the mechanical bathythermograph (MBT) instrument. The maximum depth of MBT observations is approximately 285 m. Therefore, MBT data are useful only in studying the thermal structure of the upper layers of the ocean. Cruise information, date, position, and time are reported for each observation. The data record comprises pairs of temperature-depth values. Temperature data in this file are recorded at uniform 5 m depth intervals.",

Data were collected in the South China Sea by US Navy; Ships of Opportunity from 09 May 1966 to 29 May 1966. The platform was equipped and staffed to observe weather and sea conditions. Data were processed by NODC to the NODC standard Universal Bathythermograph Output (UBT) format. Full format description is available from NODC at www.nodc.noaa.gov/General/NODC-Archive/bt.html.\n\nThe UBT file format is used for temperature-depth profile data obtained using the mechanical bathythermograph (MBT) instrument. The maximum depth of MBT observations is approximately 285 m. Therefore, MBT data are useful only in studying the thermal structure of the upper layers of the ocean. Cruise information, date, position, and time are reported for each observation. The data record comprises pairs of temperature-depth values. Temperature data in this file are recorded at uniform 5 m depth intervals.",

    "description": "The NOAA WAVEWATCH IIIÂ® hindcast dataset comprises output fields from the monthly WAVEWATCH IIIÂ® hindcast model runs conducted at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. Each model run produces a collection of files containing gridded fields comprised of input and mean wave parameters such as the significant wave height, directions, frequencies etc. Once per month, a wave simulation is carried out using restart files from the previous month and forced by hindcast wind products for the entire month. The resulting output data are transferred to NODC on a monthly basis. NODC assembles the series of files into monthly accessions to facilitate archival retention and public access. The fields are encoded in the standard GRIdded Binary version 2 (GRIB2) file format. Wave spectral data summaries are included, as well as detailed spectra at selected locations, in tabular text format. Nine different sets of output fields, corresponding to nine different grids used in the numerical simulations, are included. These include a global grid, as well as regional and coastal grids covering much of the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans.",
